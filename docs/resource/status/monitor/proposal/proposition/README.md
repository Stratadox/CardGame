# Proposition status monitor
The proposition status monitor is a [status monitor](../../README.md) for proposal 
proposition statuses. To complete means the proposal has been proposed. (Not 
necessarily accepted yet, though)

It has the properties, links and media types of a generic status monitor, in 
addition to:

## Links
- [proposals:overview](../../../../../relation/proposals/overview/README.md) - 
  The proposal that is being proposed (only available for [`completed` status](../../README.md#properties))
