# Security
["Triple A" security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_%28computer_security%29) 
consists of [three parts](https://codebots.com/application-security/aaa-security-an-introduction-to-authentication-authorisation-accounting):

- [Authentication](Authentication.md)
  > Who are you? Are you really you? Is this request authentic?
- [Authorisation](Authorisation.md)
  > Now that we know *who* you are, are you allowed to do this?
- [Accounting](Accounting.md)
  > What resources were accessed? When? By whom? What commands were issued?
